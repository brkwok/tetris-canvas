## Introduction

This Tetris project is a modified version of [Michael Kar√©n's Tetris tutorial](https://michael-karen.medium.com/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057) . It retains the core gameplay mechanics while adding new functionalities to enhance the overall gaming experience.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay of Tetris remains the same:

- Blocks (Tetriminos) fall from the top of the screen.
- Use the arrow keys to move the blocks left, right, or down.
- Rotate the blocks using the "Up" arrow key.
- Your goal is to complete horizontal lines with the falling blocks.
- Completed lines are cleared, earning you points.
- As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster, making it more challenging.
- The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
